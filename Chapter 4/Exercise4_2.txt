- Int is valid. Don't confuse it with "int". C is case-sensitive.
- Calloc is valid.
- floating is valid.
- ReInitialize is valid.
x char is NOT valid because it is a reserved keyword for a data type.
- Xx is valid.
- "_1312" is valid. Variables are allowed to start with a underscore and to contain numbers.
- "_" is also valid as weird as it may look.
x 6_05 is NOT valid because variables cannot start with a digit.
- alpha_beta_routine is allowed but it is a silly name.
- z is valid.
x A$ is not valid because $ is not allowed in a variable name.
